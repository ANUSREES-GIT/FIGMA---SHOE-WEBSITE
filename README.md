# 👟 Shoe Delivery Website — Figma Design & Spring Boot Project

This repository contains the **UI design screens** and project concept for a **Shoe Delivery Web Application** that will be developed using **Java Spring Boot**.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

The **Shoe Delivery Website** is a modern e-commerce platform designed to make online shoe shopping smooth and user-friendly.  
The UI was first designed in **Figma**, focusing on a clean layout, intuitive navigation, and responsive design principles.

Later, this design will be implemented as a **full-stack web application** using:
- **Backend:** Java Spring Boot  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (or React)  
- **Database:** MySQL or PostgreSQL
